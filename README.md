# MiniAngularApp

I developed an Angular web page that fetches employee time entry data from a REST API using a GET request. The page displays a table listing employees sorted by their total time worked. Rows are visually highlighted for employees who worked less than 100 hours.

Additionally, I implemented a pie chart on the same page that shows each employeeâ€™s share of the total time worked. The chart visually represents the data as percentages, providing a clear overview of how time was distributed. The chart was created using a charting library such as Chart.js or ngx-charts.
